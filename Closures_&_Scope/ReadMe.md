### This folder contains example implementations of Closures to understand scope of variables and how closures behave

## What is a Closure?  
A Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory.
It implements the concept of nested functions and heavily uses scope of variables to provide its functionality.
A very important one such scope is **nonlocal var**.

> Refer the code files above to understand functionalities of closures.  

[docstring_closure.ipynb](https://github.com/Divya932/Pythonic/blob/main/Closures_%26_Scope/docstring_closure.ipynb) contains code for a closure that takes a function and then checks whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters.  
Concept Tags: free variables, docstrings
